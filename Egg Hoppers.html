            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If using yeast, dissolve it in warm water along with sugar and let it activate for 5-10 minutes. Skip this step if not fermenting.</li>
                <li>In a mixing bowl, combine rice flour (and all-purpose flour if using), coconut milk, salt, and the yeast mixture (if fermenting). Mix well to form a smooth batter. Adjust the consistency to that of a slightly thin pancake batter. Allow it to ferment for a few hours or overnight for better flavor.</li>
                <li>Crack an egg into each hopper well when cooking.Optionally, season the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Optionally, season the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Pour a ladleful of batter into the pan, swirling it around to evenly coat the bottom and form a bowl-like shape.</li>
                <li>Crack an egg into the center of the batter in each well.</li>
                <li>Cover the pan with a lid and cook for a few minutes until the edges become crispy and the egg sets to your desired level of doneness. For a runny yolk, cook for a shorter time.</li>
                <li>Remove the hoppers from the pan and serve hot.</li>
